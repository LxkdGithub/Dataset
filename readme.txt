The prist/ directory contains 100 pristine video clips.

The forged/ directory contains 100 corresponding forged video clips.

Naming convention for the forged video clips:

Take 00092_028-089-233-295.mp4 for example. The name means that this
video clip is a forged version of 00092.mp4.  It contains two forged
segments: [028, 089] and [233, 295], which means that the frames from
No.28 till No.89 as well as from No.233 till No.295 have undergone
object-based tampering operations.

NOTE: the video clips are in true color. In our experiments the
extracted frames are converted to gray scale to reduce the complexity.
